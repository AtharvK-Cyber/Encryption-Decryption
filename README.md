Advanced Encryption/Decryption Web Application
This project is a web-based application for encrypting and decrypting text using multiple advanced encryption algorithms. It offers a professional and secure interface to handle sensitive data, incorporating modern encryption techniques for enhanced security.

Features:
Multi-Algorithm Encryption: Supports encryption using four different encryption algorithms. The final output is further encrypted to provide an additional layer of security.
Decryption: Allows decryption of previously encrypted data using the reciprocal process to retrieve the original input.
Interactive UI: Includes a sleek, modern interface with a professional color scheme and dynamic loading spinner for enhanced user experience.
Secure Design: Utilizes advanced design elements and animations to create a visually appealing and secure environment for data processing.
Technologies Used:
HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring and styling the web page with a professional look.
JavaScript: For implementing encryption and decryption functionality. The code is obfuscated to prevent easy reverse-engineering.
CryptoJS Library: For providing encryption algorithms.
How to Use:
Enter the Text: Input the text you want to encrypt or decrypt into the provided text box.
Provide Encryption Key: Enter a key for the encryption process.
Encrypt/Decrypt: Use the provided buttons to perform the encryption or decryption.
View Results: The results will be displayed in the output area.
